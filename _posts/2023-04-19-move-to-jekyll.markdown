Hi. Everyone whoever.
This is the first blog at Gitblog. 
I used [tistory blog](https://chelsey-records.tistory.com), that was not bad because was not difficult for posting and has great search engine.
That was helpful get ready to take a test.
But I realized gitbog can be better. I wanna have experience.
So, I'll upload what I learn at university or myself.
Have Greate Days!
